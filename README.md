# sistem-pakar-stunting

The Stop Stunting website is a platform that aims to accurately detect early symptoms of stunting in children based on symptom input provided by users. This system is designed to be easily accessed via the internet by the general public, especially parents and health workers, to support government programs to reduce the prevalence of stunting in Indonesia. Using the forward chaining method, this system performs inference and diagnoses stunting based on rules determined according to the causal factors. This website has various features, including user registration and login, a user dashboard to access symptom forms and diagnosis results, as well as an admin dashboard to manage patient, expert, disease, symptom and solution data. Through the use of this expert system, it is hoped that it can increase public awareness and understanding of the symptoms and risks of stunting, as well as the importance of nutrition and children's health.
